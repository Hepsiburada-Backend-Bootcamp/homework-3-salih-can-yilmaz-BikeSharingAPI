## Architecture
---
The application is developed using onion architecture. It is done to lower coupling and make codes cleaner. The application consists of three main layers, the Service layer, wrapped by the Repository layer, and both wrapped by the Network layer. 
### Network Layer.
---
Controllers and Middlewares are the main actors on this layer and they are responsible for routing of requests and responses. They are the first to recieve and map the data from a response and last to return the response.
### Service Layer
---
This is where the data models and main logic of the application takes place. 
### Repository Layer
---
Everything related to databases such as connecting to databases, querying databases, creating data models based on data stored in databases are done here.
## Database
---
SQLite is choosen for it's ability to initialize a database from scratch quickly on every build. Database consists of two tables: Users and Sessions. (one-to-many)

#### Query Parameters
When the get method is run without the id parameter, it returns a list of all users as in the picture.
- The orderByParams parameter can be given as orderByParams="field name ASC, field name DESC, field name DESC,..." so that it can sort by more than one field.
- The filter parameter can be used as in the example filter="Id != 1 AND Balance > 35".
- With the fields parameter, only the desired fields can be requested. Usage -> fields="Name,Surname,Balance" (Id field is required even if not specified with fields.)
